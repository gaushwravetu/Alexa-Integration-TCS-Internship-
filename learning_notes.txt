We have various packages in python which are used for speech recognition:
	1. apiai
	2. assemblyai
	3. Google-cloud-speech
	4. SpeechRecognition
	5. Pocketsphinx
	6. Watson-developer-cloud
	7. wit

We're are using speechRecognition here, In speech this package we have a class called "Recognizer class".
Recognizer class: It has instances which are used to recognize speeches. Each instances has 7 different methods to recognize speech from any audio source using various APIs.
	recognize_bing(): microsoft bing api
	recognize_google(): google api
	recognize_google_cloud(): require installation of google cloud speech package
	recognize_houndify(): api made by soundhound
	recognize_ibm(): ibm speech to text method
	recognize_sphinx(): required installation of pocketsphinx, used to run speech recognition module offline as well.
	recognize_wit(): module from witai package.


Working with Microphone: To work with microphone we will have to install PyAudio package in python.
	Microphone class: To record audio using the microphone we will have a microphone class. It will take input from microphone itself without using any audio file.

Use Case on which i worked:
	Converting speech to text using speech recognition
	Using the text to open a URL using web browser
	Searching a query using speech inside the URL.
